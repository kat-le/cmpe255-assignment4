Data Science Methodologies (CRISP-DM, KDD, SEMMA)

This assignment contains three end-to-end projects, each framed by a different data-science methodology and built to run in Google Colab:

CRISP-DM → Bike Sharing Demand (forecast hourly rentals)

KDD → MovieLens (recommendations with SVD + association rules)

SEMMA → Rossmann Store Sales (daily sales forecasting)

## Important: 
The data CSVs are included in each method’s folder.
If running in Colab, you must upload/copy those CSVs into the runtime root (usually /content) before running the notebook cells.

## Data Files & Expected Names

* CRISP-DM (Bike Sharing): train.csv, test.csv
* KDD (MovieLens): ratings.csv, movies.csv, tags.csv, links.csv
* SEMMA (Rossmann): train.csv, test.csv, store.csv
